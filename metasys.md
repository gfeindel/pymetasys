# Notes about Metasys console layout and behavior

The title of the screen appears centered on line[4].

It is not trivial to obtain a list of all objects, points or groups due
to paging behavior. Therefore, pymetasys does not support listing
all objects of a type. The operator must obtain this info himself.
